## How Does The Site Work?

- When you first enter the site, you can either start the quiz or take a peak at your competition(high scores) and prepare yourself for battle!ðŸ¦¾
- Then when you start the quiz, there is a timer that will allow you ten minutes for the entire quiz giving you one minute per question.
- However, ðŸ˜ˆ..... if you answer _**incorrectly**_ 30 seconds will be subtracted from your current time and the quiz will move forward with or with out you.ðŸ¥´
- ðŸ¤–You'll also notice there is a progress bar in the left side to remind you of how many questions you have answered.
- Further to the right of the page, you'll notice there is a score section that will give you _**10 points**_ for every question you answer correctly!âœ¨
- Unfortunately, nobody gets a reward around here for being wrong ðŸ˜‘  _**so yeah, the wrong answer means 0 points for you.**_ ðŸ¥²
- Once you finish the quiz, the site directs you to submit your username, then you can go back to the home page. 
- From the home page you can check out your recent ranks and if you didn't do so well you'll have to chance to play again once you finish the quiz ðŸ’™!
